Your character and equipment will level down according to the difficulty of the challenge, but the loot from the bosses will correspond to the real level. While traveling through time through dungeons, there is a chance to obtain items usually available in Heroic mode, as well as gain reputation with the corresponding faction.</p>

All riders are given the positive effect “UUUUUH!”, increasing the amount of experience and reputation gained by one hour. The increase in experience will be very useful when collecting sets of traditional armor and discovering allied races, the number of which has been supplemented by vulperas and mechagnomes.</p>

This way, players will have a lot of incredible abilities at their disposal that will come in handy while exploring the halls of Torghast. If you select an anima themed ability at the start of a dungeon visit, the options offered later will also change to include new themed abilities. For example, if during the Beasts of Prodigum event you choose an ability related to the Maw Beast, then after that you will receive anima abilities in Torghast that further enhance your creature. If you refuse the new anima ability and prefer the regular one, then until the end of your visit to Torghast you will not receive thematic abilities.</p>
